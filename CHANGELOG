Bugfixes

[65098] Adjusted NewsletterAdmin to new CMS Menu generation (see #2872)
[65554] a lot of methods in this class now passed $params as HTTPRequest object, rather than as a array if the function is called from Ajax or top-level of front-end, some method is called in both manner, ie. called from Ajax and called internally as well, so we need to check $params type and do further process.
